C	is quirky,   flawed,	and  an
enormous succes.	Although accidents of    history
 surely helpef,   it evidently  satisfed	a need

	for a   sysntem implementation  	language        efficient
 enough to displace	assembly  language,
  yer sufficiently   abstract  and fluent    to describe
 algortihms  and	interatctions   in a   wide variety
of  enviroments.
